## Overview  
This repository includes solutions for two tasks from Module 4: Functions & Modules in Python. The tasks are:  

- **Task 1:** Calculate factorial of a number using a function (loop or recursion).  
- **Task 2:** Perform calculations using the math module (square root, natural log, sine).  

## Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function  

### Description  
This Python program defines a function named `factorial` that takes a number as input and calculates its factorial using a loop or recursion. The function is called with a sample number, and the result is printed.  

## Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations  

### Description  
This Python program prompts the user to enter a number and uses the **math module** to calculate:  
- Square root of the number  
- Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number  
- Sine of the number (in radians)  

The results are then displayed.  

## Files  
- **A3_Task1.py:** Contains the code for calculating factorial.  
- **A3_Task2.py:** Contains the code for math module calculations.
